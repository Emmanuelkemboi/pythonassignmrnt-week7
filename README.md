📊 Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib
🎯 Objective

This assignment demonstrates:

Loading and exploring a dataset using Pandas

Performing basic data analysis (statistics, grouping, observations)

Creating simple visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

The dataset used is the Iris dataset, a classic dataset included with scikit-learn.

📂 Files

analyzing_data.py → Main Python script containing the analysis and visualizations

README.md → Instructions for running the project

⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
Install the required libraries by running:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

▶️ How to Run

Open a terminal in the project folder.

Run the script:

python analyzing_data.py


The program will:

Print dataset information and statistics in the terminal

Display four plots:

Line chart (Sepal length over index)

Bar chart (Average petal length by species)

Histogram (Distribution of sepal width)

Scatter plot (Sepal length vs Petal length)

📌 Observations

The Setosa species generally has smaller sepal and petal dimensions compared to Virginica.

Clear separation exists between species in terms of petal size.
